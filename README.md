This is the repository that holds PgMex Blog. This blog covers various aspects of connectivity between Matlab and PostgreSQL.
Among them&#8213;a degrading performance of PostgreSQL JDBC driver for large data sets.
We continue to perform an extensive investigation of this problem in a series of articles published in the blog.

We also developed a solution&#8213;high-performance <a href="http://pgmex.alliedtesting.com">PgMex client library for Matlab</a>.
The articles of the blog reveal some data size and data type-related hidden restrictions of Matlab Database Toolbox. All the published
results may be reproduced independently by downloading and launching specially developed
<a href="https://github.com/AlliedTesting/pgmex-jdbc-perf-test">PgMex-JDBC Performance Tests</a>.
